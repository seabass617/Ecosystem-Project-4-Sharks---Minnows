# Ecosystem Project 4: Sharks & Minnows

Fourth project as I make my way through "The Nature of Code". This project adds to my goldfish project by including oscillations in the form of a swimming tail.

Goal of this project: 
- To implement inheritanc and polymorpishm (and fix some encapsulation / abstraction issues);
- To create a system of particles, in this case, a system of sharks and minnows
- Allow for a lifespan (Implementing lifespan onto the food. You may be wondering why it's not the minnows for when the get eaten that they die, and that's because I don't know how :). I would 
you can't have the fish succeptible to attack if they are aware of 360 degrees of their surroundings, this can be implemented maybe when we get to "vision".)

The speed of the tail movement is proportional to the velocity of the fish, the faster it's going to faster it will move it's tail.

A few notes on how this could be improved
- Axis of tail oscillation could be moved to where it connects to the fish
- A coasting ability could be added (fish intelligence). The fish would be able to
gauge distance and stop moving it's tail so hard as to approaches the food. Almost as if it knows that it's momentum will carry it to the target. (Math!!)
