# Ecosystem Project 4: Sharks & Minnows

Fourth project as I make my way through "The Nature of Code". This project adds to my goldfish project by including oscillations in the form of a swimming tail.

Goal of this project: 
- To implement inheritance and polymorphism (and fix some encapsulation / abstraction issues);
- To create a system of particles, in this case, a system of sharks and minnows
- Allow for a lifespan (Implementing lifespan onto the food. You may be wondering why it's not the minnows for when the get eaten that they die, and that's because I don't know how :). I would 
you can't have the fish succeptible to attack if they are aware of 360 degrees of their surroundings, this can be implemented maybe when we get to "vision".)

Current Status: 
- Inheritance and Polymorphism applied. There is a Fish superclass that the minnow and sharks extend too. One system is comprised on N minnows and 1 shark. 
- Minnows are afraid of shark

To Do: 
- Allow for user input to change scare radius, scare intensity, toggle scare on and off, toggle scare radius on and off.
